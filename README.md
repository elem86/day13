# Day 13

🎯 Day 13 – One Project a Day Until I Get Hired

📅 Excel Gantt Chart for Project Planning

Today’s project was all about building a simple but powerful Gantt chart in Excel — perfect for tracking tasks and timelines visually!

✅ What I built:

  - A project task table with start dates and durations

  - A stacked bar chart simulating a Gantt chart layout

  - Clean formatting to show timelines clearly and intuitively


🧠 Why it's valuable:
Gantt charts are great for project planning, and Excel can handle them with a bit of clever layout and formatting — no specialized software needed.

🧩 Key skills used:

  - Stacked bar chart formatting

  - Category reversal, hidden series, and chart styling

  - Manual data prep and visual organization

📌 Optional extras like progress bars and dependencies can be layered on top, but for this 1–2 hour daily build, the core visualization works well!
